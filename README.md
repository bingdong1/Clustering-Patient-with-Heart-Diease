Clustering Patient with Heart Diease
Doctors frequently study former cases in order to learn ways to best treat their patients. A patient who has a similar health history or symptoms to a previous patient could benefit from undergoing the same treatment. This project investigates whether doctors might be able to group together patients to target treatments using some common unsupervised learning techniques.
